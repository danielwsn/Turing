# My Paper Title

This repository is the matlab code of [Solution landscape of reaction-diffusion systems reveals a nonlinear mechanism and spatial robustness of pattern formation] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10095). 


## Requirements

This repository requires MATLAB version R2020a or higher. Please ensure that your environment meets this requirement for optimal performance and compatibility.


## Usage
There are two separate parts of code:

1.The first one(Schnakenburg) is to construct the solution landscape of the Schnakenburg model.

2.The second part(3-species) contains the construction of solution landscape and the computation of action in a 3-species RD model.

They both contain dowmward search and upward search in HiSD algorithms
